1. number_of_runs - number of simulation with protein structure included n-number of monomers and tn-number of spheres in linker. If you want to give more accuratly data you may set this value ( with high values you may to give more data but result will be slower ). Default value for number_of_runs is 100.

2. min_nimber_of_spheres_in_the_linker (lenght of linker) - in this line you may set start lenght of linker. Number of spheres (amino acid residues) will be grow to max lenght (max_number_of_spheres_in_the_linker).

3. max_number_of_spheres_in_the_linker -  on this value "start" script stop simulation and close Blender. Default value for max_number_of_spheres_in_the_linker is 7. 

4. min_number_of_monomers -  rigid body simulation start with protein structure included this number of monomers.Step by step the structure grew to max_number_of_monomers. Default value for min_number_of_monomers is 2 . Attention! If you set value of min_number_of_monomers equal to  50 or more then simulation will take  15-20 min or more. At this time you will see only grey screen of Blender. This is normally. After simulation ended you will see result in result.txt. 

5. max_number_of_monomers - on this value "start" script stop simulation and close Blender. Default value for max_number_of_monomers is 100.  

6. diameter(A) of big spheres (globular domain) . Default value is 30. Recomended max value for this diameter is 150A.  

7. path_to_Blender  -  in this line you may to add a full path to executable file of Blender

8. Number of simulation steps taken per second (higher values are more accurate but slower). Default value for steps_per_second is 60. Max value = 1000. Recomended max value for steps_per_second is 120.
